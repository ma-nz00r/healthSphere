    <h2 class="text2">Using Family Support for Better Health Outcomes
    </h2>
    <p class="text3">Using family support to manage diabetes effectively is an important topic to explore. Diabetes is a growing challenge among Latinx and African American communities. Rates of diagnosis and complications are often higher compared to other groups. But amid this health crisis, there’s a powerful force at work in Latinx families: familismo. It’s more than just a cultural value—it’s a lifeline. In this blog, we’re diving deep into how familismo isn’t just shaping diabetes management; it’s revolutionizing it. Let’s explore how using family support to manage diabetes can be an effective strategy. By the end, you’ll learn valuable tips on staying healthy while dealing with diabetes.</p>
      <h2 class="text4">Understanding <i>Familismo</i></h2>
    <p class="text5">Now let’s talk about how familismo impacts managing diabetes. Familismo is all about families helping each other out. In Hispanic culture, family is a big deal. It’s not just about parents and kids, but also includes extended family and close friends. Also, family support shapes how families deal with health issues like diabetes. It’s not just about supporting each other emotionally—it’s about working together as a team.

        When someone in the family has diabetes, everyone pitches in to help. They go to doctor’s appointments together and make changes to their lifestyle, like eating healthier and exercising more. Familismo also means they talk openly about diabetes and make decisions together. By sticking together like this, families can face the challenges of diabetes and stay healthy together.</h2>
        <h2 class="text6">The Impact of <i>Familismo</i> and How Family Support Manages Diabetes</h2>
  <p class="text7">Now that we understand what familismo is, let’s explore how using family to manages diabetes. In Hispanic families facing diabetes, family support is like having a strong team by your side. Each member plays a role in helping the person with diabetes stay healthy. They remind them to take their medication, plan nutritious meals, and stay active. This collective effort can make it simpler for the person with diabetes to stick to their health plan and stay on the right path. As a result, it leads to improving their health outcomes.</p>
  <h2 class="text8">Overcoming Challenges and Barriers and Guidance and Support</h2>
  <p class="text9">Despite the benefits of family support, there can be challenges to managing diabetes. Even though family support helps
    with managing diabetes, families can face challenges. Sometimes, cultural beliefs about diabetes can make things harder. But by teaching about diabetes and respecting each other’s views, families can overcome these challenges.
    To conclude, familismo is very helpful for managing diabetes. It creates a strong support system that helps everyone stay healthy. By working together as a family, managing diabetes becomes easier and everyone’s quality of life improves. However, managing diabetes is not just about familial support at home—it’s also about accessing the right resources and healthcare services.

    At Sinai Chicago’s Holy Cross Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital’s Diabetes and Endocrinology services, patients have access to a dedicated multidisciplinary team consisting of physicians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, certified diabetes educators, dietitians, podiatrists, and bariatric surgeons. This comprehensive team works closely with patients and their primary care physicians to create a welcoming environment for discussing diabetes, endocrinology, and weight management needs.</p>
