        <h2>What is Spinal Cord Injury?</h2>
        <p>Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a condition caused by damage to the spinal cord, either through trauma or disease. This damage disrupts the flow of signals between the brain and the rest of the body, leading to partial or complete loss of sensation, motor function, and bodily control below the site of the injury. SCI can have profound physical, emotional, and social impacts on individuals.</p>

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>Spinal cord injuries can result from various causes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traumatic events such as car accidents, falls, sports injuries, or acts of violence</li>
            <li>Diseases such as multiple sclerosis, tumors, or infections like meningitis</li>
            <li>Medical or surgical complications affecting the spine</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="symptoms">
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of spinal cord injury depend on the severity and location of the injury. Common symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of sensation, including the ability to feel heat, cold, or touch</li>
            <li>Loss of movement or paralysis</li>
            <li>Difficulty breathing, coughing, or clearing secretions from the lungs</li>
            <li>Spasticity or exaggerated reflexes</li>
            <li>Pain or intense stinging sensations caused by nerve damage</li>
            <li>Loss of bowel or bladder control</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="treatment">
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>While there is no cure for SCI, treatment aims to prevent further injury and improve quality of life. Options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emergency care:</strong> Immobilization of the spine and rapid transport to a hospital after injury</li>
            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Corticosteroids to reduce swelling and inflammation</li>
            <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> To stabilize the spine or remove bone fragments, herniated disks, or tumors</li>
            <li><strong>Rehabilitation:</strong> Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and assistive devices to improve mobility and independence</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>Preventing spinal cord injuries involves reducing risk factors and practicing safety measures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always wear seat belts while driving or riding in a vehicle</li>
            <li>Use appropriate protective gear during sports or physical activities</li>
            <li>Install safety features at home, such as handrails and slip-resistant flooring, to prevent falls</li>
            <li>Engage in strength and flexibility exercises to improve balance and reduce fall risks</li>
            <li>Follow workplace safety guidelines, especially in high-risk environments</li>
        </ul>
