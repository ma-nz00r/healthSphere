            <h2>Causes of Down Syndrome</h2><br><br>
            <p>Down Syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. This condition is also known as Trisomy 21. The presence of this extra <br> chromosome affects the development of the brain and body. There are three types of Down Syndrome:</p><br><br>
        
        <strong>Trisomy 21:</strong> The most common type, where every cell in the body has an extra copy of chromosome 21.<br><br>
        <strong>Mosaic Down Syndrome:</strong> A less common type, where only some of the cells have an extra copy of chromosome 21.<br><br>
        <strong>Translocation Down Syndrome:</strong> When a part of chromosome 21 breaks off and attaches to another chromosome.<br><br>
        
            <p>While the exact cause of the chromosomal changes is not fully understood, advanced maternal age is a known risk factor, though it can occur in mothers of any age.</p><br><br>

        <div class="symptoms">
            <h2>Symptoms of Down Syndrome</h2><br><br>
            <p>Individuals with Down Syndrome may have a variety of symptoms, which can range from mild to moderate. Some common symptoms include:</p><br><br>
            
            Intellectual disability (mild to moderate)<br><br>
            Characteristic facial features such as a flat facial profile, upward slanting eyes, and a small mouth<br><br>
            Short stature and a smaller head<br><br>
            Weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy<br><br>
            Delayed development, including speech and motor skills<br><br>
            Health issues such as heart defects, respiratory problems, or gastrointestinal problems<br><br>
            Increased risk of certain medical conditions like leukemia, thyroid disorders, or sleep apnea<br><br>
            
        </div>

        <div class="treatment">
            <h2>Treatment for Down Syndrome</h2><br><br>
            <p>While there is no cure for Down Syndrome, early intervention can greatly improve outcomes and quality of life. Treatment may include:</p><br><br>
    
    <strong>Therapies:</strong> Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to help improve motor skills, communication, and independence.<br><br>
    <strong>Special Education:</strong> Tailored educational programs that address the learning needs of individuals with Down Syndrome.<br><br>
    <strong>Medical Care:</strong> Regular health check-ups, including monitoring for heart defects, hearing loss, and other health concerns.<br><br>
    <strong>Medication:</strong> Some individuals may require medication to manage specific health issues such as thyroid problems, or conditions like seizures.<br><br>>
    <strong>Supportive Care:</strong> Emotional and social support to help families and individuals with Down Syndrome thrive and achieve their full potential.<br><br>
    
        </div>

        <div class="prevention">
            <h2>Prevention of Down Syndrome</h2><br><br>
            <p>Down Syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs during conception, and there is no known way to prevent it. However, there are steps <br> that can help reduce the risk of certain complications:</p><br><br>
                 
            <strong>Genetic counseling:</strong> For couples with a family history of Down Syndrome or advanced maternal age, genetic counseling can provide <br> information and guidance before pregnancy.<br><br>
            <strong>Preconception care:</strong> Women planning to conceive should seek medical advice and adopt a healthy lifestyle, including proper nutrition <br> and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco or alcohol.<br><br>
            <strong>Regular prenatal care:</strong> Prenatal screenings, such as blood tests and ultrasound, can help detect the likelihood of Down Syndrome and <br>other conditions. However, these tests only assess the risk, and a definitive diagnosis can be made through amniocentesis or chorionic villus <br> sampling (CVS).<br><br>
