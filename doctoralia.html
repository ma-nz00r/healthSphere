    <h2 class="text2">The Dr. Alia Stanford Center for Health Equity: <br>
         Promoting Equitable Care for All</h2>
    <p class="text3">Health equity in the United States is a significant challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic’s disproportionate effect on people of color highlighted deep-rooted health and healthcare disparities, which have been documented for decades and stem from longstanding structural inequities rooted in historical and ongoing racism and discrimination.

        Dr. Ala Stanford, pediatric surgeon, Founder of the Black Doctors Consortium, and a national leader in health equity, was at the heart of the pandemic’s impact on Philadelphia community members. Her tireless work during this time was invaluable—an effort she continues today with the Dr. Ala Stanford Center for Health Equity. Here, she shares what
         inspired her to take on her role and how the center is elevating care in the community.</p>
      <h2 class="text4">Meeting Dire Needs During COVID-19 </h2>
    <p class="text5">During the initial stages of the pandemic, Dr. Stanford quickly realized certain individuals were not getting the care they needed. As the owner of her practice, she gathered gowns, gloves, masks, etc. and brought them to the communities where people were most impacted.

        “We did it through churches, through community workers, basically with my pastor, talking to other pastors, asking, ‘Can we use your church parking lot, your electricity and bathrooms for staff?’ I got the information just by going on the city website. I found out where the positivity rate was the highest, and then I found a church in every zip code and that’s how we triaged who was the sickest,” shares Dr. Stanford.</p>
  <h2 class="text6">Pushing for Patient Advocacy  </h2>
  <p class="text7">An integral part of ensuring individuals receive care is having a patient navigator. Dr. Stanford recalls one instance of a patient who had taken three buses across town to get to the center so he could have a wound dressing changed. By the time he arrived, he was tired and his leg was swollen.

    Yet, his insurance would have covered a ride share option. His physician should have sent dressing changes to his home. If Dr. Stanford had been able to do a virtual visit, he would have been able to stay off his feet. Unfortunately, he was not aware of those options. Had this individual had access to a patient navigator, perhaps all of the negative elements of the visit could have been avoided.
    
    “Having that patient navigator to advocate for you is so important. Proximity is important, and of course, access, access, access, and representation, cultural sensitivity. Not every Black person is going to have a Black doctor, but the data now shows us that having one Black doctor in a county can improve the outcomes because it’s someone else at the table to help you see things through the lens of the patient,” states Dr. Stanford.
    
    The center is now able to extend care even more thanks to it being designated a school-based wellness center, offering services to students in the area. “When parents are working and offices are closed at five or closed on weekends, that proximity or access is key. Being able to touch children when they’re in school and get them caught up on their vaccines and other considerations is very helpful,” she adds.</p>
