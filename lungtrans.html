    <h2>HealthSphere Approach</h2>
    <p><b>Multidisciplinary team approach:</b> Doctors trained in lung conditions (pulmonologists), chest surgery (thoracic surgeons), heart surgery (cardiac surgeons), infectious disease management, mental health (psychiatrists), and other specialties collaborate as a team to provide you with coordinated, comprehensive care.
