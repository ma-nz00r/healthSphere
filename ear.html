    <h1 class="text1">Ear Infection</h1>
    <p class="text2">Ear infection treatments can vary based on which part of the ear is infected. This includes middle ear infections (otitis media), which cause inflammation in the air-filled space behind the eardrum, and outer ear infections (otitis externa), which cause inflammation in the external ear canal. <br>
        Although earache is the primary symptom of both middle and outer ear infections, the underlying cause can differ. The treatment will depend largely on whether the cause is viral, bacterial, or fungal and may involve pain medications, antibiotics, eardrops, or watchful waiting. Some cases can be treated with home remedies, while severe cases may require ear tubes to help drain fluids.</p>

<p class="text3"><b>Can You Heal an Ear Infection Without Treatment?</b><br><br>
    Middle ear infections often heal on their own without treatment. The same may be true for outer ear infections, but they generally take longer and are more likely to require treatment. The differences are due to how each type of infection develops. <br><br>
    
  <b>  Middle Ear Infections</b><br><br>
    Otitis media is more common in children than adults. Most cases are caused by an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) like a cold or flu that causes the eustachian tube (the passageway connecting the middle ear to the back of the throat) to swell and fill with fluid. <br><br>
    
    Children are more often affected because their immune systems are less developed. Their eustachian tubes are also smaller and more horizontal, making it harder to drain fluid from the ear. Because of this, they can have recurrent infections, sometimes as many as four or five per year. <br><br>
    
    URTIs associated with middle ear infections are typically viral. These include rhinoviruses (the most common cause of colds), influenza virus (the flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). More often than not, the ear infection will clear once the viral URTI runs its course. <br><br>

   <b class="text4"> What Causes Ear Infections?</b><br><br>
   <b> Outer Ear Infections</b><br><br>
    Otitis externa can affect both children and adults. It is popularly known as swimmer's ear because water remaining in the ear after swimming creates the ideal environment for bacteria or fungi to grow. The infection can also occur when a foreign object such as a cotton swab or ear plug introduces bacteria into the ear canal. <br><br>
    
    Because the moisture in the ear canal encourages bacterial and fungal growth, it often takes a while for the immune system to control the infection. <br><br>
    
    Without treatment, it can take several weeks rather than days for an outer ear infection to clear.6 The problem with this is that, when left untreated, the persistent inflammation can cause permanent narrowing of the ear canal and hearing loss.</p>
