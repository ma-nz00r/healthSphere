    <div class="definition">
        <h2>What is Gastric Cancer?</h2><br><br>
        <p>Gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer, is a type of cancer that begins in the lining of the stomach. <br> It occurs when abnormal cells in the stomach start to grow uncontrollably, forming a tumor. <br>Gastric cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, making early detection crucial for effective treatment. It is more common in older adults, <br> especially those over the age of 60.</p><br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="causes">
        <h2>Causes</h2><br><br>
        <p>The exact cause of gastric cancer is not fully understood, but several factors may increase the risk of developing <br>the disease. Some known risk factors include:</p><br><br>
    <strong>Age and gender:</strong> Gastric cancer is more common in people over the age of 60, and men are more likely to develop the disease than women.<br><br>
    <strong>Helicobacter pylori infection:</strong> A bacterial infection in the stomach is a leading cause of gastric cancer.<br><br>
    <strong>Diet:</strong> A diet high in salty, smoked, or pickled foods may increase the risk of stomach cancer.<br><br>
    <strong>Smoking:</strong> Smoking tobacco can increase the risk of gastric cancer.<br><br>
    <strong>Family history:</strong> A family history of gastric cancer or genetic mutations may predispose individuals to the disease.<br><br>
    <strong>Chronic gastritis:</strong> Long-term inflammation of the stomach lining can increase the risk of gastric cancer.<br><br>
    
    </div>

    <div class="symptoms">
        <h2>Symptoms</h2><br><br>
        <p>The symptoms of gastric cancer can be subtle in the early stages but may become more noticeable as the disease progresses. <br>Common symptoms include:</p><br><br>
        Feeling full after eating small amounts of food<br><br>
        Indigestion or heartburn<br><br>
        Abdominal pain or discomfort<br><br>
        Nausea or vomiting<br><br>
        Unexplained weight loss<br><br>
        Loss of appetite<br><br>
        Bloody stools or vomit<br><br>
        Difficulty swallowing (in some cases<br><br>
        
    </div>

    <div class="treatment">
        <h2>Treatment</h2><br><br>
        <p>Treatment for gastric cancer depends on the stage of the cancer, its location, and the patient's overall health. <br>Common treatment options include:</p><br><br>
        
        <strong>Surgery:</strong> The most common treatment for gastric cancer is surgery to remove the tumor or the entire stomach in some cases (gastrectomy).<br><br>
        <strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Chemotherapy drugs are used to kill cancer cells or shrink tumors, and it may be used before or after surgery.<br><br>
        <strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> High-energy radiation is used to target cancer cells, often in combination with other treatments.<br><br>
        <strong>Targeted therapy:</strong> This treatment uses drugs that target specific molecules involved in cancer growth.<br><br>
        <strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Newer treatments that stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells may be used for advanced gastric cancer.<br><br>
        
    </div>

    <div class="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention</h2><br><br>
        <p>While there is no guaranteed way to prevent gastric cancer, certain lifestyle changes and early detection <br> may help reduce the risk:</p><br><br>
        
        Quit smoking and avoid tobacco use.</li>
        Eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while limiting the consumption of salty, smoked, and pickled foods.<br><br>
        Get screened for Helicobacter pylori infection, especially if you have a family history of gastric cancer.<br><br>
        Limit alcohol consumption, as excessive drinking can increase the risk of gastric cancer.<br><br>
        If you have chronic gastritis or other stomach conditions, seek treatment and regular check-ups with your healthcare provider.<br><br>
