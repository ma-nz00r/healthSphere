        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">AIDS</span> is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
          By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight infections and diseases.
        </p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>
          AIDS is caused by <span class="highlight">HIV</span>. The virus is transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or vaginal fluids. 
          Common ways of transmission include <em>unprotected sex</em>, sharing needles, or from mother to child during childbirth.
        </p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Rapid weight loss</li>
          <li>Extreme fatigue</li>
          <li>Recurring fever or night sweats</li>
          <li>Prolonged swelling of lymph glands</li>
          <li>Frequent infections</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>
          While there is no cure, HIV infection can be prevented by practicing <strong>safe sex</strong>, avoiding sharing needles, 
          and taking preventive medications like <span class="highlight">PrEP</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Antiretroviral therapy (ART)</span> is the primary treatment for HIV/AIDS. It helps control the virus, 
          improves quality of life, and reduces the risk of transmission.
