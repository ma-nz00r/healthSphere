            <h2>Causes of Cluster Headaches</h2><br><br>
            <p>Cluster headaches are a rare and severe form of headache. While the exact cause is not fully understood, several factors are believed to contribute to the development of cluster headaches:</p><br><br>
            
            Abnormalities in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that controls the body’s biological clock<br><br>
            Genetic factors (family history of cluster headaches or other types of migraines)<br><br>
            Certain environmental triggers, such as alcohol, smoking, or strong smells<br><br>
            Changes in sleep patterns or disruptions in the circadian rhythm<br><br>
            Histamine release in the body, which may lead to dilation of blood vessels in the head<br><br>
            
        </div>

        <div class="symptoms">
            <h2>Symptoms of Cluster Headaches</h2><br><br>
            <p>Cluster headaches are known for their intense, one-sided pain. Common symptoms include:</p><br><br>
            
            Severe, burning or stabbing pain around one eye or on one side of the head<br><br>
            Pain that lasts from 15 minutes to 3 hours, occurring in “clusters” over weeks or months<br><br>
            Red, teary eyes or swelling around the eye on the affected side<br><br>
            Runny or stuffy nose on the affected side<br><br>
            Restlessness or agitation during an attack<br><br>
            Possible sensitivity to light and sound during an episode<br><br>
            
        </div>

        <div class="treatment">
            <h2>Treatment for Cluster Headaches</h2><br><br>
            <p>While there is no cure for cluster headaches, treatments aim to relieve symptoms and reduce the frequency of attacks. Common treatments include:</p><br><br>
            
            <strong>Acute treatments:</strong> Oxygen therapy, triptans (e.g., sumatriptan), and local anesthetics<br><br>
            <strong>Preventive treatments:</strong> Medications such as verapamil, lithium, corticosteroids, and melatonin<br><br>
            <strong>Occipital nerve blocks:</strong> Injections of anesthetics or steroids around the nerve at the back of the head<br><br>
            <strong>Surgical intervention:</strong> In rare cases, deep brain stimulation (DBS) or occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) may be considered<br><br>
            <strong>Alternative therapies:</strong> Acupuncture, biofeedback, and behavioral therapy<br><br>

        <div class="prevention">
            <h2>Prevention of Cluster Headaches</h2><br><br>
            <p>There is no guaranteed way to prevent cluster headaches, but certain lifestyle changes and precautions may reduce their frequency and severity:</p><br><br>
            
            Avoiding known triggers, such as alcohol, smoking, and strong smells<br><br>
            Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and avoiding sleep disruptions<br><br>
            Reducing stress through relaxation techniques or regular exercise<br><br>
            Considering preventive medications as prescribed by a healthcare provider<br><br>
            Seeking early medical intervention at the first sign of a cluster period<br><br>
