    <h1 class="text1">A Lifelong Dedication: The Story of Thelma Gates</h1>
    <div class="img"></div>
    <h2 class="text2">Meet Thelma Gates</h2>
    <p class="text3">After 57 years of service, Thelma Gates recently retired from Mount Sinai Hospital, marking the end of an extraordinary career
     that has spanned nearly six decades. A lifelong South Side resident of Chicago, Gates started at the hospital in 1967, when she
      was just 18 years old. Now, at the age of 76, she reflects on the journey that has defined both her life and the evolution of 
      healthcare in Chicago.</p>
      <h2 class="text4">A Humble Beginning  </h2>
    <p class="text5">In April 1967, Mount Sinai Hospital was a very different place. The campus consisted of the Frankel and Kurzton buildings,
 alongside the main hospital—nothing like the sprawling complex it is today. Gates, however, had a front-row seat to its transformation, playing
an integral role in that journey.The road to Mount Sinai began for Thelma just after high school. A close friend from her graduating class, who
 worked as a receptionist in the Human Resources department at the hospital, called her one day with an opportunity: Mount Sinai was looking to
  hire more caregivers, and there were openings in both the blood bank and billing. Gates chose the billing department, marking the beginning of what would be a
   long and meaningful career.</p>
  <h2 class="text6">Retirement and Reflections  </h2>
  <p class="text7">As Thelma steps into retirement, she has big plans for her future. After decades of hard work, she looks forward to spending time on home projects before taking some well-deserved vacations to relax and enjoy life.

    “I’m going to miss it so much,” she says with a bittersweet smile. “It’s been my pleasure to work here. But it’s time for a new chapter.”
    
    Though Thelma may be leaving Mount Sinai Hospital, her legacy will not be forgotten. She has touched the lives of countless patients, colleagues, and healthcare professionals over the years. In a career defined
     by service, dedication, and compassion, Gates is an example of what it means to truly make a difference in the world.</p>
