    <div class="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Brain Cancer</h2><br>
        <p>Brain cancer is caused by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the brain. The exact cause is not always clear, but some common factors include:</p><br>
        
<strong>Genetic Mutations:</strong> Changes in DNA or mutations in specific genes can lead to the formation of cancerous cells in the brain. <br><br>
<strong>Radiation Exposure:</strong> Previous exposure to ionizing radiation, such as radiation therapy for other cancers, can increase the risk of developing brain cancer.<br><br>
<strong>Family History:</strong> A family history of brain cancer or other cancers may increase the likelihood of developing brain cancer.<br><br>
<strong>Age:</strong> Brain cancer can occur at any age, but some types are more common in children or adults over 60.<br><br>
<strong>Weakened Immune System:</strong> People with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those who have undergone organ transplants, may be at higher risk.</li>

    <div class="symptoms">
        <h2>Symptoms of Brain Cancer</h2><br>
        <p>The symptoms of brain cancer vary depending on the tumor's size, location, and type. Common symptoms include:</p><br>
        Headaches, which may worsen over time or in the morning<br><br>
        Seizures or convulsions<br><br>
        Nausea and vomiting, often related to increased pressure in the brain<br><br>
        Difficulty with balance, walking, or coordination<br><br>
        Vision or hearing problems<br><br>
        Memory problems, confusion, or difficulty concentrating<br><br>
        Personality or behavior changes<br><br>
        Weakness or numbness in the limbs<br><br>
        
    </div>

    <div class="treatment">
        <h2>Treatment for Brain Cancer</h2><br>
        <p>Treatment for brain cancer depends on the type, location, and stage of the cancer. Common treatment methods include:</p><br>
        <strong>Surgery:</strong> Surgery is often the first step in removing a brain tumor if it is accessible and safe to operate on.<br><br>
        <strong>Radiation Therapy:</strong> High-energy radiation is used to kill or shrink tumor cells. It may be used after surgery or as the primary treatment for inoperable tumors.<br><br>
        <strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Drugs are used to destroy cancer cells, either through oral medications or intravenous injection.<br><br>
        <strong>Targeted Therapy:</strong> Targeted therapies attack specific molecules that promote cancer cell growth, with fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy.<br><br>
        <strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> A treatment that boosts the bodyâ€™s immune system to help fight cancer cells, often used in combination with other treatments.<br><br>
        <strong>Supportive Care:</strong> Managing symptoms such as pain, nausea, and fatigue to improve the patient's quality of life.<br><br>

    <div class="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention of Brain Cancer</h2><br>
        <p>While there is no guaranteed way to prevent brain cancer, some strategies may reduce the risk:</p><br>
        <strong>Avoid Radiation Exposure:</strong> Limit unnecessary exposure to radiation, such as through medical imaging procedures, and avoid excessive sun exposure.<br><br>
        <strong>Healthy Lifestyle:</strong> Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight can improve overall health and reduce the risk of cancer.<br><br>
        <strong>Quit Smoking:</strong> Smoking is associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including brain cancer. Quitting smoking reduces this risk.<br><br>
        <strong>Protect Your Head:</strong> Wear protective gear during activities that could result in head injuries (e.g., sports, biking) to avoid traumatic brain injuries.<br><br>
        <strong>Regular Health Check-ups:</strong> Regular medical check-ups can help detect early signs of cancer and other health issues.<br><br>
