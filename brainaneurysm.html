        <h2 class="app">Hospital Approach</h2>
        <p class="app1">Mayo Clinic experts have extensive experience using brainaneurysm to treat a variety of conditions, including cancers. Mayo Clinic offers bone marrow transplants for adults and children using their own cells (autologous transplant), cells from a donor (allogeneic transplant) or cells from an umbilical cord (cord blood transplant).

            People who choose Mayo Clinic for their care receive comprehensive, compassionate and personalized attention from health care providers and staff who are committed to providing exactly the care they need. In addition, several support groups are offered at Mayo Clinic's campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.</p>

    <div class="team">
        <h2 class="team1">Your Mayo Clinic care team</h2>
        <p class="team2">Mayo Clinic specialists trained in brain conditions (neurologists), brain surgery (neurosurgeons) and nonsurgical treatments (neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists) have experience treating people who have brain aneurysms and other brain and blood vessel conditions (cerebrovascular diseases).
            Mayo Clinic's team approach means your health care providers often can diagnose your particular condition and develop a treatment plan within a few days

        <h2 class="ranking1">Bringing Research Advances to Patient Care</h2>
        <p class="ranking2">Mayo Clinic scientists are involved in cutting-edge research that allows them to apply the latest advances to patient care.Innovations include:

<p class="b1"><b >Treatment expertise.</b> Mayo Clinic specialists have wide and varied expertise treating brain aneurysms using the most current approaches:
    Endovascular techniques such as coiling or coiling in combination with stenting.
    Flow diverters for larger or more complex aneurysms.
    Other new endovascular techniques and surgery.</p>
<p class="b2"><b >Individualized treatment.</b> Mayo Clinic specialists work closely with you to develop an individualized treatment plan to prevent brain hemorrhage. The plan is based on your brain aneurysm's size and location and other aneurysm features. It's also based on the predicted risk of rupture, consideration of any family history of aneurysm rupture, your medical condition, and your preference after consulting with your Mayo Clinic providers.</p>
<p class="b3"><b >The latest diagnostic tests. </b> Mayo Clinic experts evaluate people who have brain aneurysms with computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, cerebral arteriography, cerebrospinal fluid examination and other tests.
Your health care provider may use these tests to diagnose an unruptured aneurysm and determine its size, location and other characteristics and assess the aneurysm's risk of rupture. Providers also use these tests to diagnose a ruptured aneurysm, which needs emergency treatment.</p>
<p class="b4"><b >Research</b> Mayo Clinic specialists conduct research in potential causes, risks, diagnostic tests and treatments for brain aneurysms and other brain conditions and conduct clinical trials.</p>

        <h2 class="experience1">The Clinic Experience</h2>
        <p class="experience2">Mayo Clinic specialists have extensive experience performing bone marrow transplants for adults and children with a variety of cancerous and noncancerous diseases. Mayo's physicians have performed more than 16,300 procedures since the program began in 1972.

        <h2 class="research1">Brain aneurysm expertise and innovation for patient care</h2>
        <p class="research2">Mayo Clinic scientists are involved in cutting-edge research that allows them to apply the latest advances to patient care.Innovations include:

<p class="p1"><b >Leading international studies</b> Mayo Clinic specialists and researchers have led many of the largest international studies into brain aneurysm diagnoses and treatment techniques dating back to 1991.

    Mayo Clinic served as the coordinating center for the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA). </p>
<p class="p2"><b >Pipeline embolization expertise</b>Mayo Clinic experts were early contributors in the development of pipeline embolization approaches, collaborating on both the Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms (PUFS) study as well as the Aneurysm Study of Pipeline in an Observational Registry (ASPIRE) study, both of which assessed the feasibility, safety and efficacy of flow diverters for the treatment of unruptured brain aneurysms</p>
<p class="p3"><b >American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for care</b> Mayo Clinic specialists co-chaired the AHA guidelines on caring for subarachnoid hemorrhages and on care for unruptured aneurysms.</p>
<p class="p4"><b >Certified stroke centers</b> Mayo Clinic's campus in Florida was the first stroke center in Florida to be certified as a Comprehensive Stroke Center by The Joint Commission, a national organization that evaluates and accredits health care providers. The center is the only one in its region. Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester was certified as a Comprehensive Stroke Center in 2015. Mayo Clinic's campus in Arizona is certified as a Primary Stroke Center.</p>

    <div class="eligibility">
        <h2 class="eligibility1">Patient Eligibility</h2>
        <p class="eligibility2">If your bone marrow stops working or doesn't produce healthy stem cells, you may benefit from a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplants are used to treat people whose stem cells have been damaged by disease or the treatment of a disease, or as a way to have the donor's immune system fight a blood disorder, such as leukemia.

Experts will determine whether a bone marrow transplant may be safe and beneficial for you. Your treatment team will explain the benefits and risks of a bone marrow transplant.

Your treatment team will also evaluate you to determine whether a bone marrow transplant or an alternative therapy may be the most appropriate treatment option for your condition.

    <div class="costs">
        <h2 class="costs1">Costs and Insurance</h2>
        <p class="costs2">Mayo Clinic has dedicated transplant financial services representatives and social workers who can assist you with insurance and financial questions regarding your transplant.

            Mayo Clinic works with hundreds of insurance companies and is an in-network provider for millions of people. In most cases, Mayo Clinic doesn't require a physician referral. Some insurers require referrals or may have additional requirements for certain medical care. Many insurance companies require you to get preapproval authorization prior to transplant services.
            
            Insurance information
            Before your transplant, it's important that you work closely with your insurance company to understand your benefit plan. You'll be responsible for any of your transplant and medical care costs not covered by your insurance company.
