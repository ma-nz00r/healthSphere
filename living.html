    <h2>HealthSphere Approach</h2>
    <p>
      HealthSphere has one of the most comprehensive transplant practices. 
      Our transplant doctors, surgeons, and staff at multiple HealthSphere campuses 
      have extensive experience with living-donor kidney and liver transplantation.
    </p>
    <p><b>Team approach.</b>  
      HealthSphere's integrated teams of surgeons, doctors, transplant nurses, 
      pharmacists, and other specialists work together to provide care — from 
      evaluation through post-surgery recovery. Donors undergo blood tests, 
      detailed imaging, physical and psychological evaluations to ensure they meet 
      safe donation criteria.
    </p>
    <p><b>Coordinated care.</b>  
      Having subspecialized expertise in one place means test results are available 
      quickly, appointments are well-coordinated, and your case is reviewed by 
      multiple experts working together for the best outcome.
    </p>
    <p><b>Surgical expertise.</b>  
      HealthSphere surgeons perform advanced minimally invasive surgeries such as 
      laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, reducing pain and recovery time compared to 
      open surgery.
    </p>
    <p><b>Research.</b>  
      HealthSphere researchers study the long-term health of donors and recipients, 
      offering access to ongoing clinical trials and innovative treatments.
    </p>

    <h2>Your HealthSphere Care Team</h2>
    <p>
      At HealthSphere, top-ranked doctors and specialists collaborate to provide 
      world-class transplant care. Your team may include:
    </p>
    <p>
      Neuro-oncologists, Neuroradiologists, Neuropathologists, Neurosurgeons,  
      Medical Oncologists, Radiation Oncologists, Neurologists, and Rehabilitation 
      Specialists.
    </p>

    <h2>Bringing Research Advances to Patient Care</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Advanced treatment and technology.</b>  
      HealthSphere surgeons specialize in all forms of living-donor transplantation, 
      including minimally invasive techniques, paired-organ donation, HIV-positive 
      organ donation, and other complex cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Innovation and research.</b>  
      Our researchers are leading efforts to improve every stage of transplantation, 
      reduce risks, and enhance long-term patient outcomes. The HealthSphere 
      Transplant Center supports numerous research studies focused on donor and 
      recipient care.
    </p>

    <h2>The HealthSphere Experience</h2>
    <p>
      HealthSphere surgeons have extensive experience performing living-donor 
      transplant surgeries, including <a href="#"><b>liver transplant</b></a> and 
      <a href="#"><b>kidney transplant</b></a>. Thousands of successful procedures 
      ensure that patients and donors are treated with expertise and compassion.
    </p>

    <h2>Patient Stories</h2>
    <p>
      Patients describe their HealthSphere experience as compassionate, efficient, 
      and unlike any care they’ve had before. Their stories highlight the 
      dedication and attention to detail shown by every member of our staff.
    </p>

    <h2>Costs and Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      HealthSphere works with hundreds of insurance companies and is an in-network 
      provider for millions of people.  
      In most cases, a physician referral is not required, but some insurers may 
      need prior authorization. Our financial counselors help patients confirm 
      coverage and explore payment options.
    </p>

    <h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
    <p>
      HealthSphere conducts ongoing clinical trials on transplantation to discover 
      new ways of preventing complications, improving donor safety, and enhancing 
      recipient outcomes.
