        <h2 class="research1">Advanced diagnosis and treatment</h2>
        <p class="research2">People who seek care at Mayo Clinic have access to the most advanced imaging and diagnostic tools available. There's a long history of Mayo Clinic scientists developing those cutting-edge technologies for patient care.

            Mayo Clinic neuropathologists are skilled in analyzing brain tumor tissue in the lab to make an accurate diagnosis. They analyze many tissue samples every year and have access to the latest in lab technology. Neuropathologists at Mayo Clinic have experience in diagnosing all types of brain tumors, including very rare types. Getting an accurate diagnosis helps your health care team create the most effective treatment plan for you.
            
            Innovation by Mayo Clinic doctors and scientists led to the development of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and related slip interface imaging. This advanced imaging technique allows physicians to better prepare for brain tumor removal surgery. The technology provides vital information about the firmness and adhesion of brain tumors. This information allows the multidisciplinary care team to determine the optimal method and timing for surgery in order to reduce the risk of potential complications or follow-up surgeries.
            
            Mayo Clinic neurosurgeons perform more than 2,900 brain tumor surgeries each year using the latest technologies and tools available to them, including:
