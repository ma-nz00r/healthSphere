        <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
        <p class="short-detail">
           In recent years, the widespread use of social media platforms and search engines has created a vast source of real-time data that can be leveraged for public health monitoring. People frequently share information about their health conditions, symptoms, and concerns online, while search queries reflect collective public interest and emerging disease trends. Mining these digital footprints enables researchers and healthcare authorities to detect disease outbreaks earlier than traditional reporting methods.
<br>
By analyzing patterns in social media posts, hashtags, and search engine queries, health organizations can track the spread of infectious diseases, monitor public sentiment, and identify emerging health threats. This approach not only complements conventional epidemiological methods but also provides a cost-effective and timely solution for disease surveillance. The integration of big data analytics, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms further enhances the ability to detect trends, predict outbreaks, and respond proactively to public health crises
