<b class="text3"> Insights from a Passionate Breast Surgeon</b>
<p class="text2"><b class="b1">Introduction </b><br><br>
In the journey of breast health, having a skilled and compassionate surgeon makes all the difference.Meet Dr. Raquel Gonzalez Heredia,
a dedicated breast surgeon at Sinai Chicago. With her extensive expertise and a patient-centered approach, Dr. Faiqa is committed to
providing exceptional care for her patients. </pre>

<b class="b2">What Inspired You to Become a Breast Surgeon? </b>

One of my favorite aspects of being a breast surgeon is the opportunity to work closely with women. I find it incredibly rewarding
to build long-term relationships with my patients and provide continuity of care. The survival rates for breast cancer are remarkably
 high, which fills me with hope. Additionally, I’m passionate about the cosmetic side of surgery. It’s essential for women undergoing
  these procedures to feel confident and beautiful. I want them to leave the hospital feeling like themselves, not defined by their illness. 

<b class="b3">Approach to Patient Care</b>
Dr. Gonzalez Heredia believes in treating the whole person, not just the disease. She takes the time to listen to her patients,
understand their concerns, and involve them in decision-making about their care. Her empathetic approach ensures that patients 
feel supported throughout their treatment journey.
