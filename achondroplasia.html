        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Achondroplasia</span> is a rare genetic disorder that results in dwarfism. 
          It affects bone growth, particularly in the arms and legs, leading to shorter stature while the trunk remains relatively normal in size.
        </p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>
          This condition is caused by a <strong>mutation in the FGFR3 gene</strong>, which plays a role in converting cartilage into bone. 
          The mutation leads to abnormal bone development and growth.
        </p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Short arms and legs with normal-sized torso</li>
          <li>Large head with prominent forehead</li>
          <li>Flattened nasal bridge</li>
          <li>Limited range of motion at the elbows</li>
          <li>Spinal curvature (lordosis or kyphosis)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
          There is no cure for achondroplasia, but treatments can help manage complications. 
          These include physical therapy, surgery for bone alignment, and medications to improve bone growth in children.
        </p>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>
          Since achondroplasia is a genetic condition, there is no known prevention. 
          However, <em>genetic counseling</em> can help families understand their risks and options.
