        <h2 class="app">Hospital Approach</h2>
        <p class="app1">Mayo Clinic experts have extensive experience using bone marrow transplants to treat a variety of conditions, including cancers. Mayo Clinic offers bone marrow transplants for adults and children using their own cells (autologous transplant), cells from a donor (allogeneic transplant) or cells from an umbilical cord (cord blood transplant).

            People who choose Mayo Clinic for their care receive comprehensive, compassionate and personalized attention from health care providers and staff who are committed to providing exactly the care they need. In addition, several support groups are offered at Mayo Clinic's campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.</p>

    <div class="team">
        <h2 class="team1">Our Team</h2>
        <p class="team2">At Mayo Clinic, health care providers who specialize in blood diseases (hematologists) form a multidisciplinary team with other experts to provide personalized, whole-person care to adults and children undergoing bone marrow transplants.
            Your transplant team may include hematologists, cancer specialists (oncologists), mental health specialists (psychologists and psychiatrists), a bone marrow transplant scheduling coordinator, transfusion medicine nurses, trained and specialized nurses, physician assistants, social workers, a nurse coordinator, a clinical nurse specialist, a dietitian, pharmacists, a chaplain and a child life specialist for children undergoing bone marrow transplant.

    <div class="experience">
        <h2 class="experience1">The Clinic Experience</h2>
        <p class="experience2">Mayo Clinic specialists have extensive experience performing bone marrow transplants for adults and children with a variety of cancerous and noncancerous diseases. Mayo's physicians have performed more than 16,300 procedures since the program began in 1972.

        <h2 class="research1">Bringing Research Advances to Patient Care</h2>
        <p class="research2">Mayo Clinic scientists are involved in cutting-edge research that allows them to apply the latest advances to patient care.Innovations include:

<p class="p1"><b >Haploidentical transplant.</b> This type of transplant uses stem cells from donors who aren't perfect matches. Research is helping to bring understanding about how to reduce the risk of complications and improve recovery for people whose stem cell donors aren't perfect matches.</p>
<p class="p2"><b >Reduced-intensity conditioning.</b> Using lower doses of chemotherapy and radiation before a transplant may allow older people and those who aren't healthy enough for conditioning to undergo bone marrow transplants.</p>
<p class="p3"><b >Cord blood transplant.</b> This type of transplant is done using stored and frozen umbilical cord blood. There are fewer stem cells in cord blood, but those stem cells can grow more blood cells than can those collected from bone marrow. Using cells from cord blood reduces the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Researchers are identifying the best ways to use cord blood for bone marrow transplants and finding new ways to track these cells after transplant.</p>
<p class="p4"><b >Expanding indications for bone marrow transplant.</b> Researchers are studying ways to use this treatment for a wider variety of conditions, including complicated and rare diseases.</p>
<p class="p5"><b >New medication options.</b> Mayo Clinic researchers study medications and treatments for people who have had bone marrow transplants, including new medications to help people stay healthy after a bone marrow transplant.</p>
<p class="p6"><b >Reduced time in the hospital. </b>At Mayo Clinic, some bone marrow transplants are performed as hospital-based outpatient procedures, which reduces the amount of time spent in the hospital.</p>

    <div class="eligibility">
        <h2 class="eligibility1">Patient Eligibility</h2>
        <p class="eligibility2">If your bone marrow stops working or doesn't produce healthy stem cells, you may benefit from a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplants are used to treat people whose stem cells have been damaged by disease or the treatment of a disease, or as a way to have the donor's immune system fight a blood disorder, such as leukemia.

Experts will determine whether a bone marrow transplant may be safe and beneficial for you. Your treatment team will explain the benefits and risks of a bone marrow transplant.

Your treatment team will also evaluate you to determine whether a bone marrow transplant or an alternative therapy may be the most appropriate treatment option for your condition.

    <div class="costs">
        <h2 class="costs1">Costs and Insurance</h2>
        <p class="costs2">Mayo Clinic has dedicated transplant financial services representatives and social workers who can assist you with insurance and financial questions regarding your transplant.

            Mayo Clinic works with hundreds of insurance companies and is an in-network provider for millions of people. In most cases, Mayo Clinic doesn't require a physician referral. Some insurers require referrals or may have additional requirements for certain medical care. Many insurance companies require you to get preapproval authorization prior to transplant services.
            
            Insurance information
            Before your transplant, it's important that you work closely with your insurance company to understand your benefit plan. You'll be responsible for any of your transplant and medical care costs not covered by your insurance company.
