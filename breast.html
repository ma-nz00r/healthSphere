        <h2>Causes of Breast Cancer</h2><br>
        <p>Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast grow uncontrollably. The exact cause is not always known, but several factors can increase the risk of developing breast cancer:</p><br>
        
<strong>Genetic Mutations:</strong> Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. <br><br>
<strong>Hormonal Factors:</strong> Estrogen and progesterone can stimulate the growth of certain types of breast cancer. Hormonal therapy and prolonged exposure to these hormones may increase the risk.<br><br>
<strong>Family History:</strong> Having a close family member, such as a mother or sister, with breast cancer increases the risk of developing it.<br><br>
<strong>Age:</strong> The risk of breast cancer increases with age, especially after 50 years.<br><br>
<strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, and being overweight can increase the risk.<br><br>
<strong>Radiation Exposure:</strong> Previous radiation treatment to the chest area can increase the risk of breast cancer.<br><br>

    <div class="symptoms">
        <h2>Symptoms of Breast Cancer</h2><br>
        <p>Breast cancer symptoms may vary from person to person. Common symptoms include:</p><br>
        
A lump in the breast or underarm<br><br>
Changes in the size, shape, or appearance of the breast<br><br>
Unexplained pain in the breast or nipple<br><br>
Skin changes, such as redness or dimpling of the skin<br><br>
Discharge from the nipple, other than breast milk<br><br>
Swelling or thickening of the breast tissue<br><br>

    </div>

    <div class="treatment">
        <h2>Treatment for Breast Cancer</h2><br>
        <p>Breast cancer treatment depends on the type, stage, and location of the cancer. The common treatment options include:</p><br>
        
<strong>Surgery:</strong> The removal of the tumor or the entire breast (mastectomy) is often necessary to treat breast cancer.<br><br>
<strong>Radiation Therapy:</strong> High-energy radiation is used to kill or shrink cancer cells, typically after surgery to remove any remaining cancer cells.<br><br>
<strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Drugs are used to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant) to prevent recurrence.<br><br>
<strong>Hormonal Therapy:</strong> Medications that block or lower estrogen levels can be used to treat hormone-receptor-positive breast cancers.<br><br>
<strong>Targeted Therapy:</strong> Targeted drugs attack specific molecules involved in cancer cell growth, offering a more precise treatment with fewer side effects.<br><br>
<strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Immunotherapy boosts the bodyâ€™s immune system to help it recognize and destroy cancer cells.<br><br>

    <div class="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention of Breast Cancer</h2><br>
        <p>While there is no guaranteed way to prevent breast cancer, several strategies may reduce the risk:</p><br>

<strong>Regular Screenings:</strong> Mammograms, breast exams, and genetic testing can help detect breast cancer early, when it is most treatable.<br><br>
<strong>Healthy Lifestyle:</strong> Eating a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and avoiding excessive alcohol intake can help reduce the risk.<br><br>
<strong>Avoid Hormonal Therapy:</strong> If possible, avoid prolonged use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or birth control pills.<br><br>
<strong>Limit Radiation Exposure:</strong> Minimize unnecessary radiation exposure, especially during childhood or adolescence.<br><br>
<strong>Breastfeeding:</strong> Breastfeeding may lower the risk of breast cancer for women, especially if done for extended periods.<br><br>
<strong>Know Your Family History:</strong> Discuss any family history of breast cancer with your doctor, and consider genetic counseling if you are at higher risk.<br><br>
