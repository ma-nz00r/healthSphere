        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes of Colon Cancer</h2>
            <p>Colon cancer occurs when cells in the colon or rectum grow uncontrollably. Several factors can increase the risk of developing colon cancer, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Age (risk increases after 50)</li>
                <li>Family history of colorectal cancer or polyps</li>
                <li>Inherited genetic mutations (e.g., Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis)</li>
                <li>A diet high in red or processed meats</li>
                <li>Physical inactivity</li>
                <li>Obesity</li>
                <li>Heavy alcohol use and smoking</li>
                <li>Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="symptoms">
            <h2>Symptoms of Colon Cancer</h2>
            <p>Colon cancer symptoms can vary depending on the tumor's size and location in the colon. Common symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Change in bowel habits (diarrhea or constipation)</li>
                <li>Blood in the stool or rectal bleeding</li>
                <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
                <li>Abdominal pain or discomfort</li>
                <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                <li>Feeling that the bowel doesn’t empty completely</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="treatment">
            <h2>Treatment for Colon Cancer</h2>
            <p>The treatment for colon cancer depends on its stage, location, and the patient's overall health. Common treatment options include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> Removal of the tumor or part of the colon</li>
                <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Use of drugs to kill cancer cells or stop their growth</li>
                <li><strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> Targeted radiation to shrink tumors before surgery or destroy remaining cancer cells post-surgery</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted therapy:</strong> Medications that target specific cancer cell molecules involved in tumor growth</li>
                <li><strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Strengthening the body’s immune system to attack cancer cells</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="prevention">
            <h2>Prevention of Colon Cancer</h2>
            <p>While colon cancer cannot be completely prevented, adopting certain lifestyle changes can significantly reduce the risk of developing the disease:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and fiber</li>
                <li>Regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight</li>
                <li>Limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding smoking</li>
                <li>Getting regular screening tests (e.g., colonoscopy) after the age of 50 or earlier if at high risk</li>
                <li>Removing precancerous polyps through screening</li>
                <li>Consider genetic counseling if there is a family history of colon cancer or inherited genetic conditions</li>
            </ul>
