    <div class="definition">
        <h2>What is Gallbladder Cancer?</h2><br><br>
        <p>Gallbladder cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the gallbladder, a small organ beneath the liver that stores bile. <br>It is often difficult to detect in its early stages because it usually does not cause symptoms until it has progressed. <br>By the time it is diagnosed, gallbladder cancer may have spread to nearby tissues and organs.</p><br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="causes">
        <h2>Causes</h2><br><br>
        <p>The exact cause of gallbladder cancer is not known, but several factors may increase the risk of developing this type of cancer. <br>These include:</p><br><br>
            
        <strong>Age and gender:</strong> Gallbladder cancer is more common in people over the age of 70 and is more common in women than men.<br><br>
        <strong>Gallstones:</strong> The presence of gallstones, which can irritate the gallbladder, may increase the risk of cancer.<br><br>
        <strong>Chronic inflammation:</strong> Conditions that cause chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, such as chronic cholecystitis, may increase cancer risk.<br><br>
        <strong>Obesity:</strong> Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of gallbladder cancer.<br><br>
        <strong>Genetic factors:</strong> Family history and certain genetic mutations can increase the risk of gallbladder cancer.<br><br>
        <strong>Certain infections:</strong> Infection with the liver fluke parasite has been linked to an increased risk of gallbladder <br> cancer, especially in certain parts of the world.<br><br>
        
    </div>

    <div class="symptoms">
        <h2>Symptoms</h2><br><br>
        <p>Gallbladder cancer often does not cause symptoms in the early stages. However, as the cancer progresses, the following <br>symptoms may appear:</p>
        
        Abdominal pain, especially in the upper right side<br><br>
        Unexplained weight loss<br><br>
        Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)<br><br>
        Nausea and vomiting<br><br>
        Loss of appetite<br><br>
        Fever<br><br>
        Swelling in the abdomen<br><br>
        
    </div>

    <div class="treatment">
        <h2>Treatment</h2><br><br>
        <p>Treatment for gallbladder cancer depends on the stage of the cancer, the overall health of the patient, and other factors. <br> Common treatment options include:</p><br><br>
        
        <strong>Surgery:</strong> The primary treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgical removal of the gallbladder, along with surrounding <br>tissue and lymph nodes if the cancer has spread.<br><br>
        <strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Chemotherapy drugs are used to kill cancer cells or shrink tumors, either before or after surgery.<br><br>
        <strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> High-energy radiation may be used to target and kill cancer cells in certain cases.<br><br>
        <strong>Targeted therapy:</strong> Medications that target specific genes or proteins involved in the growth of cancer cells may be used in some cases.<br><br>
        <strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> New treatments are being explored that use the body's immune system to attack and destroy cancer cells.<br><br>
        <strong>Palliative care:</strong> In advanced stages, palliative care may be used to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.<br><br>
        
    </div>

    <div class="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention</h2><br><br>
        <p>There is no guaranteed way to prevent gallbladder cancer, but certain steps may reduce the risk:</p><br><br>
            <li>Maintaining a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular physical activity<br><br>
            <li>Avoiding obesity and managing weight-related health conditions<br><br>
            <li>Seeking treatment for gallstones or chronic gallbladder inflammation<br><br>
            <li>Avoiding excessive alcohol consumption<br><br>
            <li>Consulting with a healthcare provider if you have a family history of gallbladder cancer
            <li>Being cautious about liver fluke infections in areas where the parasite is prevalent
