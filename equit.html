    <div class="img"></div>
    <h2 class="text2">Celebrating Community Health Worker Awareness Week
    </h2>
    <p class="text3">At Sinai Chicago, our community health workers are central to efforts in addressing clinical and community integration 
and the social determinants of health. Their core values are built on trust, dignity and respect bridging the gap between healthcare even beyond
the hospital walls. CHWs provide inpatient and post-discharge support for Sinai Chicago patients.  At Sinai Urban Health Institut
 (the research arm of Sinai Chicago) they are a leader in CHW interventions, training and workforce development.
  Over the last several years, CHWs have screened nearly 11,000 patients for unmet social needs that can impact their health (food and housing
insecurity, utility support needs, transportation, primary care and more), identifying over 3,000 patients with needs. Top needs identified
 include: connections to primary care provider, food, utility support, transportation. Sinai Chicago continues to expand its CHW workforce, including expansion into behavioral health, mom and baby units, and oncology over the last year or so. Sinai has become a Department of Labor Registered Apprenticeship Program sponsor, the first healthcare system in Illinois to do so and has been identified as the curriculum and training collaborator for the Illinois Department of Public Health CHW Certification Program.</p>
      <h2 class="text4">Why are community health workers such a hot topic right now in healthcare?</h2>
    <p class="text5">CHWs have become a focal point in healthcare due to their critical role during the pandemic, where they provided essential support by connecting families to services and addressing social determinants of health. Their ability to offer culturally relevant care from within the community has shifted how healthcare is delivered, making them indispensable in both clinical and community settings. Communities welcomed the answer for help coming from people who looked like them and understood their challenged intimately, changing the face of what healthcare traditionally looked like. </h2>
        <h2 class="text6">How has SUHI really advanced the role over the years?</h2>
  <p class="text7">SUHI has been instrumental in advancing the role of CHWs, starting over 20 years ago with initiatives addressing disparities in breast cancer among women of color. By expanding to pediatric asthma care and incorporating home visits, SUHI demonstrated the effectiveness of CHWs in reducing ER visits and improving quality of life. Today, CHWs are integral to SUHIâ€™s protocols in supporting behavioral health, oncology, and maternal care, reflecting their essential role in patient health management.</p>
