        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Addison’s disease</span>, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, 
          is a rare disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, 
          particularly cortisol and aldosterone.
        </p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>
          The most common cause is <strong>autoimmune damage</strong> to the adrenal glands. 
          Other causes include infections like tuberculosis, adrenal tumors, or genetic defects.
        </p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Chronic fatigue and muscle weakness</li>
          <li>Weight loss and decreased appetite</li>
          <li>Darkening of the skin (hyperpigmentation)</li>
          <li>Low blood pressure and fainting</li>
          <li>Craving for salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
          Treatment involves <span class="highlight">hormone replacement therapy</span> to correct the levels 
          of deficient hormones. Patients often take lifelong medication to manage symptoms.
        </p>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>
          There is no guaranteed prevention for Addison’s disease, 
          but early diagnosis and treatment can prevent life-threatening complications like 
          <em>Addisonian crisis</em>.
