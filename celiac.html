            <h2>Causes of Celiac Disease</h2><br><br>
            <p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the ingestion of gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye) causes <br>damage to the small intestine. The exact cause is not fully understood, but the following factors are believed to contribute:</p><br><br>
            
            Genetic predisposition (family history of celiac disease or other autoimmune disorders)<br><br>
            Abnormal immune system response to gluten, which damages the intestinal lining<br><br>
            Environmental triggers such as infections, stress, or surgery<br><br>
            Presence of other autoimmune diseases like Type 1 diabetes or autoimmune thyroid disease<br><br>
            
        </div>

        <div class="symptoms">
            <h2>Symptoms of Celiac Disease</h2><br><br>
            <p>Symptoms can vary from mild to severe and may affect various parts of the body. Common symptoms include:</p><br><br>
            
            Chronic diarrhea or constipation<br><br>
            Abdominal pain, bloating, or cramping<br><br>
            Fatigue or weakness<br><br>
            Unexplained weight loss<br><br>
            Skin rashes (Dermatitis herpetiformis)<br><br>
            Iron-deficiency anemia<br><br>
            Delayed growth or development in children<br><br>
            Joint pain or bone disorders<br><br>
            
        </div>

        <div class="treatment">
            <h2>Treatment for Celiac Disease</h2><br><br>
            <p>The only effective treatment for celiac disease is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. By avoiding foods containing gluten, individuals can <br> manage symptoms and prevent further damage to the intestines. Additional treatments may include:</p><br><br>
            
            <strong>Gluten-free diet:</strong> Strict avoidance of foods containing wheat, barley, and rye<br><br>
            <strong>Supplements:</strong> Iron, calcium, and vitamin D supplements to address deficiencies<br><br>
            <strong>Medications:</strong> In some cases, corticosteroids or other immune-modulating drugs may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms<br><br>
            <strong>Monitoring and follow-up:</strong> Regular check-ups to monitor intestinal health and screen for other complications<br><br>

        <div class="prevention">
            <h2>Prevention of Celiac Disease</h2><br><br>
            <p>There is no known way to prevent celiac disease, as it is primarily influenced by genetic factors. However, early diagnosis and adhering to <br>a gluten-free diet can prevent the progression of the disease and help manage symptoms effectively. Tips for managing celiac disease include:</p><br><br>
            
            Early screening for those with a family history of celiac disease or other autoimmune conditions<br><br>
            Educating and training individuals on how to maintain a gluten-free lifestyle<br><br>
            Being vigilant about hidden sources of gluten in processed foods and medications<br><br>
            Maintaining a balanced diet with proper nutrient intake (iron, calcium, vitamins) to support overall health<br><br>
